== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= 1. What are "New Sale Price" and "New Sale Discount"? =

The "New Sale Price" action changes the sale price to an amount or a percentage of the current sale price. This action is typically used for adjusting sale prices. The "New Sale Discount" action changes the sale price to an amount or a percentage off the regular price. This is handy for creating sales like "20% off". The "Sale From" and "Sale To" dates are optional for both actions and have no effect when left empty.

This version only supports simple and external/affiliate products, but support for variable products will be added to a future version.

= 3. Does the value need a minus symbol before it? =

No.  Use positive numbers or zero, or an empty value to clear the results.
