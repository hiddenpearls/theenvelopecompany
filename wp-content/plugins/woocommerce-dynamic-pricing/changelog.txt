*** Dynamic Pricing Changelog ***

    * Fix:  Installer issue on WC 2.5.5 and below.
    * New:  Filter to get custom pricing rules for a cart item when using advanced product discounts.  Filter was added

2016.06.26 - version 2.11.2
	* Update:  No longer need to filter price HTML for variable products.  
		   Change from 2.11.1 which calculates the individual variation prices will cause WC Core to correctly display the correct details. 
	* Fix:  Fix rule builder for block rules when adding more than one special offer row.
    * Change:   Percentage discounts are now calculated using the exact amount you enter.  Previously you could enter in 50 OR .5 in the
                amount box and the result would be 50% discount.
                Now if you enter in .5 or 0.5 you will actually be getting a half a percent discount.
                Please review your rules if you have previously entered in things like .5 for a 50% discount.   If you now want to
                have a 50% discount the amount must read 50, not the previously allowed value of .5
